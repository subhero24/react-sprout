When using useSyncExternalStore, there is no internal state. So only external controlled routers, or browser routers are possible.
Memory routers are not possible in combination with useSyncExternalStore

Should useLoader for a loader which returns a response return the response, or the result of the response?

let [Link, navigations] = useLink()
let [Form, navigations] = useForm()
let [navigate, navigations] = useNavigate()



let navigations = useNavigations()


let history = useHistory()
let location = useLocation()


let loader = useLoader()

let error = useActionError()
let action = useActionResult()

We prefer using { url, signal, headers } to passing { request } as we do not think passing in the body of the request to the loaders is a good idea. 
Only the action should have the data as loaders can be partial page results when reloading some loaders.
