When using useSyncExternalStore, there is no internal state. So only external controlled routers, or browser routers are possible.
Memory routers are not possible in combination with useSyncExternalStore








We prefer using { url, signal, headers } to passing { request } as we do not think passing in the body of the request to the loaders is a good idea. 
Only the action should have the data as loaders can be partial page results when reloading some loaders.
