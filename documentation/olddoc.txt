Think about iframes and window.location vs document.location


Should loaders be called after failed action on external or initial request?
I'm thinking yes ...

// TODO: Add button and input components



!!!POST start should only abort pending loader GETs

!!!When a GET completes, cancel all other running GETS that have a runtime without completing concurrent POSTs
A GET request that started later, but ends sooner should cancel the other GET?

ALGO:
- When GET request finishes, cancel all pending GETS that started earlier. 
- Also cancel all pending GETS that started after the last completing POST.


!!!Search route matches in parallel when the parents have the same priority, if multiple matches are found
pick the one with highest total path score
